# Computer Science Books

Hello Everyone !

Welcome to my `Computer Science Books` repository. Here, you will find `PDF` versions of books relevant to the below CS realmsðŸ”»
1. <b>Data Science</b>
2. <b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b>
3. <b>Mathematics</b>
4. <b>Programming Languages</b>
5. <b>Operating Systems</b>
6. <b>Version Control : Git and GitHub</b>
7. <b>Coding Interview ðŸŒŸ<b>

<br>
 
 >NOTE : Some of the books may seem outdated because the latest versions might not be available in the electronic format. But majority of times, the earlier and the current version carries very little to no difference - after all, the knowledge inside can be <b><i>"old, not obsolete !"</i></b>

I will try to upload more books to make this repo more useful.

Thank You - Happy Learning !!!
